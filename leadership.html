		<p> On campus, I am involved in a 501(c) non-profit organization 
			called <a href = "https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/">Liberty in North Korea</a> in 
			which I am the External Vice President for our UMich rescue team chapter. Our main 
			objectives are to bring awareness to the current situation on North Korean refugees,
			raise funds for their journey of escaping to rehabilitation, and create a sense of
			belonging for our tight-knit community of students.</p> <br>

			<a href = "https://www.akdphi.org/"> alpha Kappa Delta Phi.</a> I serve as the Vice 
			President of Finance where I dedicate my time and efforts in handling all aspects of our 
			chapter's funds and financial obligations. Our sorority's purpose is to raise Asian-Awareness, 
			leadership, scholarship, sisterhood, and service. </p>
