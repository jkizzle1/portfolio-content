	<main>
		<p> This section just highlights the things I enjoy doing in my
			free time and who I am as a person outside of my 
		    academic/work life! Feel free to browse what I have been up to
			lately and what kinds of things I am interested in. </p> <br>

		<h3> Traveling </h3> <br>

		<p> Every break I get during the school year, I like to travel to places 
			with friends and family. So far, I have been to a good number of different 
			states in the U.S. as well as the Mediterranean, Bahamas, Mexico, and the 
			Dominican Republic. </p> <br>

		<h3>Bean</h3>
		<img src = "images/bean.jpg" alt="Bean" width="200"/> <br>
		<p> This past summer, my family decided to get a puppy. Her name is Bean and she 
			will soon be one years old. I spent the summer taking care of her and training 
			her in my free time. </p> <br>

		<h3>Swimming</h3>

		<p>I have been a competitive swimmer for thirteen years. Some notable mentions are 
			that I was the GA State Record Holder (Girls 9-10yo, 50 yard Backstroke), 
			GA 7A High School State Winner (200 Medley Relay), two time GA Zone Team member, and
			multiple first places at the GA State Championships (long course and short course). </p> <br>
