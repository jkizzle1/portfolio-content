			<p> Every break I get during the school year, I like to travel to places 
				with friends and family. So far, I have been to a good number of different 
				states in the U.S. as well as the Mediterranean, Bahamas, Mexico, and the 
				Dominican Republic. </p>

			<p> This past summer, my family decided to get a puppy. Her name is Bean and she
