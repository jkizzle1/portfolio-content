			<p> I decided to go out of state for college so I could experience a new 
				environment outside of my home bubble and grow into the person I want 
				to be in the future. I am passionate about finding the connections 
				between information, people, and technology. With my educational 
				background, I will strive to make technology access equitable and 
				transparent for all groups of people. </p>

				<p> The problem space: Our team's goal was to take a vague, unfinished concept and transform it into 
					concise plans, creating a final digital prototype as our end goal. Our mission was create a product 
					that provides fun, feasible recipes for food-insecure individuals while being conscious of their 
					limited access to ingredients. With this purpose in mind, we created "Quico." </p>

				<p> In this project, I worked with CSV files to sharpen my skills in data management 
					and analysis. This project looks at online AP exam race and ethnicity data to 
					compare it, state by state, with state race and ethnicity data. </p>

		<h3>Coding Project</h3>
		<p>This project takes data from 3 different APIs (Youtube, Itunes, Napster Music) 
			and creates a database using SQLite in Python. Using the database created, 
			we performed desired calculations and created visuals to represent the data 
			using matplotlib. The overall goal of this project was to access the popularity 
			of the top artists of 23 music genres.</p>
