				<h6> "Quico" </h6> 
				<p> The problem space: Our team's goal was to take a vague, unfinished concept and transform it into 
					concise plans, creating a final digital prototype as our end goal. Our mission was create a product 
					that provides fun, feasible recipes for food-insecure individuals while being conscious of their 
					limited access to ingredients. With this purpose in mind, we created "Quico." </p>
				<h6>Case Overview</h6>
				<img src="images/quico.png" alt="Screenshot of wireframe of Quico interface" width="200">
				<img src = "images/projectslide.png" alt="A graphic that describes the features of Quico" width="200" />
				<ul>
					<li>01: Created a problem statement and perform a competitive analysis</li>
					<li>02: Conducted user interviews to better understand our users' goals, motivations, needs, and pain points.</li>
					<li>03: Brainstormed personas, design scenarios, and user flows to portray our target domain</li>
					<li>04: Performed both lo-fidelity/high fidelity prototype testing of the wireframes</li>
					<li>05: Recruited testers for usability evaluations (heuristics)</li>
					<li>06: Presented a demo of our final digital prototype</li>
				</ul>
				<h6>Challenges</h6>
				<p>
					Beginning stages: The original problem space we wanted to tackle was the concept of e-learning 
					and how we can improve the experience of online learning for both instructors and students. However, we quickly ran 
					into difficulties of what kind of functions we wanted our prototype to have, especially since there are 
					many existing competitors on the market such as Canvas, Zoom, Microsoft Teams,  etc. In short, 
					the scope of our project was too wide. <br> Solution: We sought guidance from our professor 
					to help narrow our scope and leverage the ideas we already had to stay on track of our 
					project timeline. Getting help from a more experienced advisor helped us fine-tune our idea 
					of e-learning and transform it to help users learn how to cook and provide recipes for people in need. <br>
					Throughout the process: Being on a team of 4 and having set weekly deadlines, we found it difficult to 
					divide the work equally and make sure everyone was contributing with their voices constantly being heard. 
					In order to avoid overshadowing and allow each team member to collaborate with their thoughts/opinions, 
					we held brainstorming sessions in the beginning of each week to incorporate all of our ideas to find the 
					most efficient solutions. During our meetings, we followed a project management plan in which we 
					dedicated specific tasks to each member and also provided a space for compliments, constructive 
					criticism, and feedback for any necessary improvements and changes. </p>
				<h6>The Outcome</h6>
				<p>
					Our final prototype benefits our users by giving them the ability to filter and find recipes based 
					on a variety of constraints like the number/type of ingredients, specific tools, prep time, and 
					the total price. The most unique feature our app has to offer is inspired by the University of Michigan's 
					Maize & Blue Cupboard “Cook with a Chef", where users are able to attend online cooking sessions with 
					a real chef! We implemented an “Events” feature where users can get deeper, interactive instructions 
					through live cooking that goes beyond just written steps and video guides.

				<img src = "images/csv.png" alt="CSV File" width="200"/>
				<img src = "images/csvcode.png" alt="CSV Code" width="200"/>
				<p> The scope: This project takes data from 3 different APIs (Youtube, Itunes, Napster Music) and 
					creates a database using SQLite in Python. Using the database created, we performed 
					desired calculations and created visuals to represent the data using matplotlib. The 
					overall goal of this project was to use Napster, iTunes, and Youtube APIs to produce 
					analytic insights of popular music by genre. We do this through a variety of variables 
					such as subscribers, view count, song length, and song price as well as the overall 
					popularity of artists. </p> 
				<h6>Goals Achieved</h6>
				<ul>
					<li>Created visualizations that produce music analytics by genre</li>
					<li>scatterplot that plotted an artist’s Youtube view count vs. subscribers color coded by genre</li>
					<li>histograms looking at the average play counts, average subscribers, and average song length by genre</li>
					<li>pie chart that visualizes the proportion of artists with above 500k subs or below 500k subs</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Coding Project</h3>
		<p>This project takes data from 3 different APIs (Youtube, Itunes, Napster Music) 
			and creates a database using SQLite in Python. Using the database created, 
			we performed desired calculations and created visuals to represent the data 
			using matplotlib. The overall goal of this project was to access the popularity
