		<p> I decided to go out of state for college so I could experience a new 
			environment outside of my home bubble and grow into the person I want 
			to be in the future. I am passionate about finding the connections 
			between information, people, and technology. With my educational 
			background, I will strive to make technology access equitable and 
			transparent for all groups of people. </p> <br>

		<h3> Reading from & writing to Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files </h3> <br>
		<p> In this project, I worked with CSV files to sharpen my skills in data management 
			and analysis. This project looks at online AP exam race and ethnicity data to 
			compare it, state by state, with state race and ethnicity data. </p> <br>

		<h3>SI 582 Interactive Design </h3>
		<p>Currently, I am working on a semester long project where my team and I are creating
			a prototype by the end of the semester. Our goal is to go through the 
			design and research process for our target domain and create a deliverable that meets
			needs and wants. We are tackling the problem space of providing access to food banks and 
			fun, time efficient, easy recipes for food-insecure individuals. </p> <br>

		<h3>Coding Project</h3>
		<p>This project takes data from 3 different APIs (Youtube, Itunes, Napster Music) 
			and creates a database using SQLite in Python. Using the database created, 
			we performed desired calculations and created visuals to represent the data 
			using matplotlib. The overall goal of this project was to access the popularity 
			of the top artists of 23 music genres.</p>
